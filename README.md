# Welcome to the official Windows Console issues & samples repo! 

## Issues

This is not a formal support channel and that support is offered on a best-effort basis. However, this repo is actively monitored by the Windows Console engineering team who love to receive issue reports containing as much detail as possible, especially issues containing repro-steps, and screenshots :)
